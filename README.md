Google App Password Setup
If you have 2-Step Verification enabled on your Google account, you'll need to generate an App Password to use in this script. Here's how to do it:

Go to your Google Account Security Page.
Under "Signing in to Google," make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled.
Once enabled, youâ€™ll see a section for App Passwords. Click on it.
Select Mail from the drop-down menu and choose your device (or select Other to name it something like "OTP Email Sender").
Click Generate. Google will show you a 16-character password.
Copy this password and replace your_app_password_here in the code with the generated password.
